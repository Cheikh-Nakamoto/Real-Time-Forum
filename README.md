# Real Time Forum

### Objectives
On this project you will have to focus on a few points:
- Registration and Login
- Creation of posts
    * Commenting posts
- Private Messages

As you already did the first forum you can use part of the code, but not all of it. Your new forum will have five different parts:
- **SQLite**, in which you will store data, just like in the previous forum
- **Golang**, in which you will handle data and Websockets (Backend)
- **Javascript**, in which you will handle all the Frontend events and clients Websockets
- **HTML**, in which you will organize the elements of the page
- **CSS**, in which you will stylize the elements of the page

You will have only one HTML file, so every change of page you want to do, should be handled in the Javascript. This can be called having a single page application.
